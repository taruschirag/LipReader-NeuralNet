# LipReader-NeuralNet
An ongoing project that uses LipNets data to train a Neural Network and decipher what the person in the video is saying just based on the lip movements. 
# Technologies Used
Used Tensorflow to train the Deep Learning Network and OpenCVs libraries for reading the frames from the videos
